# AGENTS.md — galexp3

Persistent memory for repository-specific knowledge. Update this file
when new patterns, decisions, or gotchas are discovered.

## Project shape

- Browser-based 4X space game. Master of Orion / Galactic Civilizations style.
- Stack: TypeScript, Vite, Vitest, PixiJS (planned), IndexedDB (planned),
  Quint (spec + invariants).
- Single-player, turn-based. Galaxy map + decision menus as the spine.
- Layer separation: `sim/` (pure) / `ui/` (PixiJS) / `io/` (IndexedDB) / `ai/`.
- Persistence model: full state saved per turn.

## Methodology

- Quint specs are canonical. TypeScript modules mirror them.
- For every Quint invariant, there must be a Vitest property test in TS
  (using `fast-check`). This catches drift if Quint compile / TS hand-write
  fall out of step.
- Workflow per iteration: spec → property tests → MVP → review → next.
- Iteration cadence is intentionally small. Don't try to do everything at
  once. Pause for review between iterations.

## Iteration log

### Iter 1a — Galaxy data model

**Scope (current):**
- Types: `GalaxySize`, `Position`, `StarKind`, `Star`, `Galaxy`.
- Generator: `initGalaxy(seed, size)` deterministic, Poisson-disk in a
  bounded disc.
- Validity: `isValidGalaxy(g)`.
- Invariants: star count matches size, ids unique, positions unique,
  all within disc.

**Scope (deliberately excluded until later iters):**
- Players, empires, planets, fleets, win states, AI, persistence, UI.

**Decisions logged:**
- Galaxy size presets use **Master of Orion (1993)** counts:
  Small=24, Medium=33, Large=48, Huge=72.
  MoO 2 used 24/40/56/80 — swap `STAR_COUNT_FOR_SIZE` if MoO 2 numbers
  are preferred.
- Galaxy is a **bounded disc** (thematic; matches MoO feel). No torus,
  no wrap-around. Change `galaxyRadius` and the disc predicate to switch.
- Star generation uses seeded **Mulberry32** PRNG + Poisson-disk style
  rejection sampling. Deterministic for any (seed, size) pair.
- Star kinds are a closed set of six: Blue, White, Yellow, Red, Orange, Brown.
  Real spectral classification is richer; extend as gameplay requires.

### Iter 1d — Gaussian-blurred star halos

**Scope:**
- Each star's halo (atmospheric scatter) is rendered into a per-star
  `Graphics` wrapped in a `BlurFilter`, then drawn before the sharp
  body + spikes. The blur is **only on the halo**, so the star reads
  as a sharp point of light surrounded by soft bloom.
- Blur strength scales with star size (Dwarf 2 px, Standard 4 px,
  Giant 7 px, Supergiant 10 px).
- `filterArea` on each halo `Graphics` is inflated to
  `ceil(glowRadius + 3*blurStrength + 2)` in each axis so PixiJS
  doesn't clip the blurred kernel.
- `STAR_GLOW_ALPHA` bumped 64 → 110 so the bloom reads against the
  dark galaxy disc.

**Spec mirror:**
- `quint/galaxy.qnt` — new `STAR_BLUR_PX` defs + static check
  `starBlurOrdering` (Supergiant > Giant > Standard > Dwarf).
- `src/sim/galaxy.ts` — `STAR_BLUR_PX_FOR_SIZE` export.
- `src/sim/galaxy.test.ts` — existing sizeOrdering test extended to
  also assert strict blur ordering.

**Decisions logged:**
- Used PixiJS `BlurFilter` (built-in) on a single `Graphics` rather
  than a `Container` — the filter pipeline applies to `Graphics`
  directly in v8.
- `quality` left at the constructor default (4) — fully sufficient
  for halos this small. Bump only if visible banding appears.
- Bloom strength was tuned UP from iter-1d-in-progress initial values
  (1/2/3/4 → 2/4/7/10). The earlier values were invisible at any
  practical zoom and on the dark blue disc.

**Debugging breadcrumbs for the future:**
- If a blur (or any filter) suddenly stops appearing, check
  `app.renderer.type`.  Must be 1 (WebGL) or 2 (WebGPU).  Anything
  else → renderer silently downgraded to Canvas → filters no-op.
- Initial visual impressions of "blurs that look identical to no
  blur" often mean the blur is rendering but at a strength that's
  too low to read. Bump strength before suspecting broken plumbing.

### Iter 1e — Numeric star size + new colour palette + layered bloom

**Scope:**
- Replaced the 4-tier `StarSize` enum (Dwarf/Standard/Giant/Supergiant)
  with a numeric `size: int` in `[1, 100]`. Will later govern resource
  yield of a colonised star.
- Replaced the colour palette: dropped Blue & Brown (looked like
  artifacts on the dark disc), added Green & Purple for visual variety
  (not realistic in MK classification — gameplay colours).
  New set: **White, Yellow, Orange, Red, Green, Purple**.
- Dropped diffraction spikes — the new layered bloom renders as a
  realistic astrophotography-style point of light with halo.
- Each star is now four PixiJS layers (back to front):
  1. Outer halo (`STAR_HALO_COLOR_FOR_COLOR`, `haloRadius`, low alpha,
     **heavy** blur — atmospheric scatter)
  2. Inner bloom (body colour, `bloomRadius`, medium alpha, medium blur)
  3. White core (pure white, `bodyRadius`, opaque, **lesser** blur)
  4. Sharp highlight dot (white, ~0.4× bodyRadius, opaque, no blur —
     pixel-precise centre for bright stars)
- All pixel choices derived from `starBodyPx(size)`, `starBloomPx(size)`,
  `starHaloPx(size)`, `starBloomBlurPx(size)`, `starHaloBlurPx(size)`,
  `starCoreBlurPx(size)` — every star in the galaxy uses the same
  formulas; no per-galaxy tuning.
- New **procedural starfield** backdrop — ~2000 deterministic dust
  stars (~3.5/kpx²) painted into a single Graphics in one draw call,
  tinted mostly white with some warm/cool accent. Sits behind the
  galaxy disc.

**Spec mirror:**
- `quint/galaxy.qnt` — `StarColor = White | Yellow | Red | Orange |
  Green | Purple`, `STAR_COLOR_FOR_COLOR` table, `STAR_HALO_COLOR_FOR_COLOR`
  table, `STAR_BODY_PX/BLOOM/HALO_PX/BLOOM_BLUR_PX/HALO_BLUR_PX/
  CORE_BLUR_PX` formulas, new `allStarsHaveValidSize` predicate.
  Static checks added: `bodyRadiusInRange`, `haloBlurIsMonotonic`,
  `haloBlurHeaviest`, `everyColourHasBodyAndHalo`,
  `starSizeRangeIsSane`.
- `quint/starmap.qnt` — `StarKind` alias renamed to `StarColor`
  with the new variants; `Star` struct gains `color` + `size`.

**Decisions logged:**
- **Uniform** size distribution across [1, 100] for now. Unnatural
  (real galaxies have many more small stars than large) but better
  for gameplay — predictable variability, no dead-stars syndrome
  where half the map has nothing useful. Switch to a power-law
  distribution later when we balance resources.
- Body colour is separate from halo colour. Body uses the softer hue
  (e.g. Yellow body 0xffe680) while halo uses the more saturated
  variant (0xffd040). The contrast makes the scatter read as light
  bleeding past the star rather than a shadow.
- White is a special case — body and halo both whitish (0xffffff
  body, 0xdde8ff halo). They are allowed to match because a pure
  white halo around a white star reads correctly.
- Three blur layers instead of one. The "heavy" halo blur is the
  dominant feature (range 2..12 px); the "lesser" core blur keeps
  the white centre sharp but softens pixel edges (range 0..3 px);
  bloom blur sits between (range 1..5 px).
- Each star is FOUR PixiJS Graphics (halo/bloom/core/highlight),
  not one. Cost: ~4× draw calls per star. At 72 stars (Huge) = 288
  draw calls — comfortably under the practical limit. If we ever
  push to >500 stars we'll revisit with batched container.
- Dust starfield rendered once at mount, NOT re-rendered on galaxy
  change. The dust belongs to the viewport, not the galaxy.
- Poisson-disk min-distance in `initGalaxy` is now allowed to
  relax progressively (up to 30%) if the disc can't fit the target
  star count at the calculated spacing. The test for "no two
  stars closer than minDist" uses the same 30% allowance.

**Debugging breadcrumbs for the future:**
- PixiJS Graphics with a `BlurFilter` require a non-zero
  `filterArea` larger than the visible bounds. Rule of thumb used:
  `ceil(radius + 3*blurStrength + 2)` per axis. Forget this and the
  blur renders as a hard circle (clip).
- The `BackgroundColor` for the PixiJS app is `0`. Any dust drawn
  before the disc fill will be painted over. Dust is drawn first
  (behind disc); this is intentional so the disc reads as a region
  of dense gas rather than a window into a star cloud.

- `npm run spec:simulate` — bounded simulator run of the spec.

## Environment notes — PixiJS renderer in this dev sandbox

- The dev sandbox browser **does** expose WebGL (PixiJS ends up with
  `app.renderer.type === 1`). Iter 1d confirmed this: `BlurFilter`
  applied to per-star halos renders correctly.
- The earlier note (written before any Pixi work) about a lack of
  WebGL turned out to be wrong — guess and check, don't trust
  prior negative notes.
- Even so, the menu background still has **two render paths**
  selected by `webglAvailable()` at mount time, because some CI /
  preview environments *do* lack WebGL and we want the menu to
  render somewhere:
    - WebGL available → `mountShaderVortex()` (PixiJS GlProgram +
      Filter)
    - no WebGL → `mountCssVortex()` (CSS conic + radial gradients)
- When debugging "filter has no visible effect", first verify the
  active renderer type via `app.renderer.type` after init — must be
  `1` (WebGL) or `2` (WebGPU) for filters to run. If it's `4`
  (Canvas), GPU features won't run.
